In the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, staying informed is essential, but the sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. This project aims to simplify the process by aggregating open data from various sources and utilizing AI to summarize, evaluate, and organize it based on relevant keywords. The objective is to make it easier and faster to find the most important and relevant information.

*Disclaimer:On top of that, I’m using this project as a way to dive deeper into AI and sharpen my programming skills in Go. It’s a fun way to learn while building something useful!*
